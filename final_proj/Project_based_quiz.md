1. What is the purpose of the ItemNotFoundException class in the Java code provided in the final project?

- To initialize the shopping cart application
- ==To handle cases where an item is not found in the shopping cart
- To store the prices of items
- To calculate the total price of items in the shopping cart

2. Which method is used to read user input in the Java code provided in the final project?

- scanner.next()
- scanner.read()
- ==scanner.nextLine()
- System.in

3. What happens when the user types 'finish' in the shopping cart application?

- The application exits immediately.
- ==The current user's shopping ends and their total bill is displayed.
- A new item is added to the cart.
- An error message is displayed.

4. How does the code handle invalid inputs when asking for the quantity of an item?

- ==It prints an error message and asks for input again.
- It throws an ItemNotFoundException.
- It adds zero quantity to the bill.
- It exits the application.

5. What is the main purpose of the outer infinite loop in the Java code?

- To handle exceptions during item lookup.
- ==To allow multiple users to use the shopping cart without restarting the program.
- To initialize the item and price arrays.
- To calculate the total bill for a single user.

6. Describe how the program calculates the total bill for a user.
   The program calculates the total bill by getting information from each item by the user input, calculating the cost and adding it to the total bill.

7. What is the role of the Scanner class in the Java program provided in the final project?
   The role of the Scanner class is to enable users to interact with the application using input for item names, quantities, and control the program flow through commands such as finish and exit.

8. Explain how the program handles a situation where an item is not found.
   The program informs the user, by throwing an ItemNotFoundException with a message stating that the item is not found and lets the user try again.

9. The program exits when the user types 'exit' after finishing shopping.

- ==True
- False

10. The inner loop is responsible for handling multiple users in the shopping cart application.

- True
- ==False
